    <p class="prog">
      Hi, I’m Adomas — a curious mind taking my first steps into the world of
      tech, design, and self-made progress. I’m currently building my very first
      website as a portfolio project, learning as I go with no previous
      experience but a lot of determination.
    </p>

    <p class="prog">
      I come from a mixed background of creativity, discipline, and real-world
      hustle. Whether it’s training in MMA, exploring AI through online courses,
      or writing code while dreaming big, I’m someone who learns by doing. I’m
      passionate about turning ideas into reality — from designing T-shirts that
      raise awareness for wild cats, to experimenting with animation, web
      design, and everything in between.
    </p>

    <p class="prog">
      This site is just the beginning. I aim to grow into a creator who blends
      art, technology, and purpose — one project at a time. Thanks for visiting
      and joining me on this journey..
    </p>
